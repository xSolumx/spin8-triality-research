# Triangular Triality SchurScan

## Core architecture

Use representation-theoretic state coordinates rather than treating Clifford
grades as unrelated channels. For each irreducible type `lambda`, factor state
as multiplicity space tensor representation space. The within-stream token
action is

```text
M_t,lambda tensor rho_lambda(g_t),
```

which composes exactly and gives the SchurScan monoid. Between streams, use the
Spin(8) triality tensor only along an acyclic dependency graph:

```text
S+ scan ----\
              triality bind ---> V drive ---> V scan
S- scan ----/
```

Every box is an affine associative scan. The binding between stages is
pointwise and activation-free. Parallel depth is a constant number of
`O(log N)` stages; recurrent cache is `8+8+8=24` scalars per channel.

The maintained parallel implementation now uses an ordered, work-efficient
prefix tree.  Its operation count is linear in sequence length; the earlier
Hillis--Steele reference remains available as a correctness and performance
control.  See
[`INTERTWINER_SCHURSCAN_BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md`](../experiments/INTERTWINER_SCHURSCAN_BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md).

## The 81D / 89D distinction

Two different lifted spaces appeared in the historical notes and must not be
conflated:

\[
1+8+8+64=81
\]

is the homogeneous lift for the two source streams and their tensor product,

\[
[1,s^+,s^-,s^+\otimes s^-].
\]

It proves closure of the triality binding drive but does not contain the
downstream vector state.  The complete single-stage lift of the displayed
three-stream recurrence is

\[
1+8+8+64+8=89,
\]

with coordinates

\[
[1,s^+,s^-,s^+\otimes s^-,v].
\]

The practical staged recurrence materializes neither lift and streams only 24
scalars.  The 89D construction is a proof oracle, not the benchmarked runtime
state.

## Why this is better than the original proposal

- It states exactly where nonlinearity lives.
- It does not pretend a bilinear feedback recurrence is affine.
- It preserves exact scan/streaming equivalence.
- It uses shared Spin(8) structure across `8s`, `8c`, and `8v`, unlike a single
  chiral stream that is merely another SO(8) chart.
- It exposes a formal no-go boundary: recurrent cycles cause unbounded degree
  unless additional closure exists.

## Evidence already passed

- Complete Cl(3) isotypic centralizer: dimension 8 versus old rank 4.
- SchurScan affine associativity: `1.11e-16` error.
- SchurScan length-17 parallel/recurrent parity: below `9e-16`.
- Triality lifted one-step closure: `8.88e-16`.
- Triality shared-action equivariance: `4.44e-15`.
- Practical staged scan parity: `4.27e-14`.

## Binding and memory gates now passed

The first masked cross-representation completion gate passes through length
512. A learned bilinear tensor rediscovers the supplied triality law, whereas
matched linear and MLP controls fail. The original training design was
full-rank, so a second preregistered gate deliberately reduced the bilinear
feature rank to 16 of 64. The infinitesimal equivariance system has a unique
invariant tensor direction; a one-parameter invariant model generalizes at
cosine 1.0 in 3/3 seeds, while unconstrained bilinear and MLP models fit the
observed cells below 1.2e-6 MSE and collapse off-support.

The multi-item capacity boundary is now explicit. One 8D triality vector is an
exact single-pair store, not a high-capacity VSA. Orthogonal multiplicity codes
give exact retrieval for (K\le H); for (K>H), unit-norm tight frames attain
the optimal average linear crosstalk bound ((K-H)/H). An eight-slot
token-selective overwrite recurrence then combines hard slot replacement,
shared Spin(8) transport, and an associative affine scan. Its length-128
parallel/recurrent and symbolic-oracle errors remain below 2.3e-15.

See the masked-completion, identifiability, and coded-memory result documents
under the experiments folder.

## Next empirical gate

Addresses, query keys, and Spin(8) actions are still supplied. The next honest
task must learn slot allocation and query routing under a frozen state budget,
then compare against:

- a same-width direct slot memory with no triality;
- diagonal/complex selective SSM memory;
- bilinear fast weights or linear attention;
- Householder/DeltaProduct transport;
- nonlinear cleanup outside the recurrent scan.

The exact rows should be used as mechanism oracles, not mixed into a claim
that attention has already been replaced.

Before another task benchmark, the scan itself had to pass an engineering
gate.  That gate is now complete for eager PyTorch: noncommutative ordering,
irregular lengths, gradients, a length-2,048 recurrence, CPU/CUDA memory, and
forward/full-gradient timing all have maintained artifacts.  The next systems
gate is a fused direct-affine kernel; no fused-kernel speed claim is currently
made.

## Blind shared-action result

The first oracle-removal gate now passes. Training exposes only five columns of
the vector and positive-chiral token actions; three columns and the complete
negative-chiral action remain hidden. The paired observation Jacobian has rank
28. A joint shared-tangent retraction recovers the hidden family in 10/10
seeds, preserves triality to 1.67e-15, and remains above 0.999999995 cosine at
length 2048.

An independently optimized Lie control is exactly orthogonal and fits the
visible endpoints below 7.6e-14, yet cannot resolve the representation-specific
stabilizer slack: its unseen negative cosine is only 0.870--0.907 and its
length-2048 worst-representation cosine is negative in every seed. This
isolates shared cross-representation geometry rather than norm stabilization.

The next address-oracle gate now also passes. A jointly Sinkhorn-retracted
eight-key/eight-slot family, trained only on single-key endpoints, reaches
collision-free permutations in 10/10 seeds and remains exact on unseen
mixed-key sequences through length 2048. Independently normalized rows fit
training essentially exactly but collide and fail; untrained joint rows fail
0/10. The same-width direct memory passes at parity, so this establishes
shared-family address completion rather than a triality advantage.

The logical key identity has now been removed in a controlled 24D continuous-
alias world. Separate write/query encoders with unlabeled marginal balance pass
10/10 on noisier untouched aliases and unseen mixed-key sequences through
length 2048. Independent encoders fit locally yet collide in every seed.
Same-width direct slots pass at parity; oracle-projected delta passes while
learned delta does not, isolating content-key robustness rather than recurrent
capacity.

The Spin(8) action remains supplied. The next gate is joint blind action and
alias recovery, followed by nonorthogonal/unbalanced capacity stress and
naturalistic selective-copy/MQAR—not language scaling yet.
