## The capacity correction

For unit key \(p\), triality binding is an orthogonal map
\(M(p):S^-\to V\). Single-pair retrieval is exact, but every wrong pair in an
uncoded superposition contributes an orthogonal image with the same norm as
its stored value. In one channel the
observed mean relative squared errors are 1.0, 2.989, 6.953, and 14.755 for
2, 4, 8, and 16 associations, agreeing with the prediction (K-1). The
random-key inner-product value (1/8) is not an attenuation factor for this
bind--unbind operator.

## Exact multiplicity coding

With code columns \(c_k\in\mathbb R^H\),

\[
\widehat n_q=n_q+\sum_{k\ne q}
\langle c_q,c_k\rangle M(p_q)^TM(p_k)n_k.
\]

Orthonormal columns therefore cancel every cross-term. Across all
\(K\leq H\leq32\) cells, the maximum relative retrieval error was
8.53e-16.

Random unit codes followed the predicted mean squared error \((K-1)/H\);
the largest relative discrepancy over the full grid was 0.1903, inside the
frozen 20% gate.

## Optimal overcomplete coding

For unit code columns, the frame-potential bound gives the coefficient-energy
inequality

\[
\frac1K\sum_q\sum_{k\ne q}\langle c_q,c_k\rangle^2
\ge \frac{K-H}{H}
\]

when \(K>H\). Unit-norm tight frames attain it. For independent, zero-mean
isotropic stored values, cross-vector terms vanish in expectation, so the same
quantity is the expected relative squared retrieval error. It is not a
deterministic lower bound for every correlated or adversarial value set. The
largest empirical relative discrepancy from this random-value prediction was
0.0587, and every tested overcomplete tight frame with \(H>1\) beat its
matched random code.

| Channels \(H\) | Associations \(K\) | Random-code MSE | Tight-frame MSE | Frame-potential bound | Coherence |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 4 | 5 | 1.0003 | 0.2483 | 0.25 | 0.25 |
| 8 | 9 | 1.0180 | 0.1244 | 0.125 | 0.125 |
| 16 | 17 | 0.9986 | 0.06096 | 0.0625 | 0.0625 |
| 8 | 16 | 1.8713 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |

The last row is an important warning: truncated Walsh tight frames attain the
optimal average frame potential while pairing some columns at coherence one.
Regular simplex frames distribute interference uniformly and have better
worst-case behavior. Average optimality is not a worst-case guarantee.

## Dynamic addressed overwrite

The static codebook was extended to a real recurrent memory:

\[
M_t[h]=r_t[h]V_tM_{t-1}[h]+B_t[h].
\]

A hard zero retention and triality drive replace one addressed slot; untouched
slots undergo the shared Spin(8) transport. Because all retention operators
are diagonal in one fixed orthogonal multiplicity basis, the transition family
is closed under associative composition.

Across a length-128, eight-slot random overwrite/transport stress test:

- transition associativity error: 2.22e-16;
- parallel/recurrent state error: 9.44e-16;
- recurrent versus directly rebuilt symbolic memory: 2.22e-15;
- final retrieval of all current slot values: 1.05e-15.

This is an exact addressed \(H\)-slot dynamic memory with constant recurrent
state and logarithmic-depth parallel training.

## Dynamic and scan contracts

- shared Spin(8) memory transport versus rebuilding from transported keys and
  values: 8.88e-16 maximum error;
- retrieval after shared transport: 6.66e-16 maximum error;
- length-64, eight-channel generic affine prefix scan versus recurrent
  execution: 2.22e-15 maximum error.

All frozen gates passed.

## Prior art and defensible contribution

[Hiratani and Sompolinsky (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07186) already
develop octonion quadratic binding, analyze its multi-pair capacity, derive
lower bounds, and enlarge the composition layer. Octonion binding and
capacity scaling are therefore not novelty claims here. Tight frames and
their Welch/frame-potential bound are also classical.

[Gated DeltaNet-2 (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22791) already separates
erase and write gates in fixed-state linear attention, and
[Erase-then-Delta Attention (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26560) already
uses independently addressed rank-one erasure with chunkwise parallel
execution. Exact addressed overwrite and parallel recurrent memory are
therefore not standalone novelty claims either. The direct-slot and delta-rule
families are mandatory baselines for the learned-routing gate.

The project-specific construction is the conjunction of:

1. chiral-key, chiral-value, and vector-memory roles tied by the unique
   Spin(8) triality tensor;
2. optimal multiplicity-space coding;
3. exact addressed overwrite in a shared slot basis;
4. shared noncommutative Spin(8) transport of stored associations; and
5. an exactly associative selective affine scan with constant recurrent state.

Whether that conjunction is publishably novel requires a broader literature
review and task-level baselines.

## No-free-lunch boundary

Exact storage of \(K\) arbitrary 8D values requires at least \(H=K\)
independent multiplicity dimensions in this linear construction. When
\(K>H\), the rank bound makes nonzero average code-correlation energy
unavoidable; for independent isotropic stored values this is nonzero expected
retrieval MSE. A particular correlated value collection may exhibit accidental
cross-term cancellation, but the map cannot recover every possible value
collection exactly. Addresses and query keys are supplied in the dynamic-slot
gate. Cleanup decoders may trade approximation and codebook assumptions for
capacity, but they do not invalidate this linear rank bound.
